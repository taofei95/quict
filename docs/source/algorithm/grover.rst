Grover
======

Quantum computer has a great advantage over classical computer in its
superior speed searching databases. More specifically, Grover's
algorithm demonstrates this capability. This algorithm speed up an
unstructured search problem quadratically, and can serve as a subroutine
in a variety of other algorithms for improvement. Some variation of
Grover's algorithm, such as Partial Grover Search, provides a tradeoff
between running speed and searching precision.

Standard Grover Search
----------------------

Search algorithm with one target. The detailed explanation can be found
in QCQI [1]_.

Partial Grover Search
---------------------

Partial Grover Search with one target. See `this
paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407122>`__ for detailed
explanation.
